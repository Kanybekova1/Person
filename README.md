# Book Class

A Book class in this project simulates a book's particulars, including its title, author, year, genre, and optional rating system. By showing information and letting users rate the books, it also shows how to construct numerous Book objects and interact with them.

- book.py contains the class code 

- book test.py tests book.py code 

Book class consists of parametrized construtors such as title, author etc. and default ones as year and genre.

Book class asks user to input the number of books they want, then asks to give information to it. In the end, it diplays all information and rating of the written books.
